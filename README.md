## The Promise of Cohesion

With the release announcement for the new Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) 4.0 specification occurring earlier this year on March 26, 2020, the much anticipated movement for the next technological leap in cable internet technology has been set in motion. In development since the year 2017, the new DOCSIS 4.0 standard promises to provide the means of increased unification of the worldwide internet society by providing "up to 10 Gbps speeds downstream capacity and up to 6 Gbps upstream  capacity, easily allowing for multi-gigabit symmetric services" (*DOCSIS 4.0 Technology*). These speeds can be provisioned using a single cable internet service line, meaning the next step to home internet speeds is 10 Gig speeds, a major improvement from the 1 Gig speeds offered by most major cable service providers.

The entity leading the DOCSIS standard development, Cable Labs, believes the technological improvements laid out in the DOCSIS 4.0 standard will enable society to enter the next generation of technological advancement and connectivity by enabling the use of bandwidth intensive devices and applications. As more and more advanced methods of communication, data sending and retrieval and real time application streams are developed, the need for a higher capacity to facilitate these advancements is increasingly becoming apparent. The bandwidth capability improvements to cable internet service presented in the DOCSIS 4.0 standard aim to pave the way to tackling this compounding need for faster means of data transmission.

The primary technological advancements to cable internet communications in the DOCSIS 4.0 standard come in the form of an improved Full-Duplex (FDX) technology, allowing efficient concurrent upstream and downstream transmission across the same frequency range, and an extended Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) technique that will allow for increased upstream bandwidth capacity. Fortunately, the DOCSIS 4.0 standard, as it stands today, will not require any infrastructure improvements to the existing cable service provider network available around the globe, much of the ground work to moving to a complete DOCSIS 4.0 was completed by the DOCSIS 3.1 standard. DOCSIS 4.0 was created to begin the start of the advanced era of cable internet service and provide society with the means to accomplish more in the business, medical, technology and home consumer sectors.



## Getting There

Historically, major improvements to a signal transmission standard has required extensive improvements in the medium transmitting the data itself, the physical wires, equipment and nodes at which the vast network of signal transmitting intersects. Fortunately, the DOCSIS 4.0 specification will come at minimal cost to the stakeholders involved with entering into the new era of cable internet service provisioning because the current infrastructure supporting DOCSIS 3.1 communications can be used to adopt the new standard with minimal change. As it is said, no new cable will need to be laid to provide the new DOCSIS 4.0 at a mass scale. The ease of adoption and seamless integration of the DOCSIS 4.0 standard could be regarded as one of its major benefits, and possibly it's greatest feature in terms of mass adoption.  

The current cable internet and television infrastructure, which provides cable internet service to more than 90% of homes in the United States, consists of legacy Hybrid Fiber Coaxial (HFC) capable of providing data transmission using the new DOCSIS 4.0 Standard (*Full Duplex DOCSIS Technology*). The repurposing of the HFC infrastructure for use with the new DOCSIS 4.0 is only possible if a major change in the implementation of the physical layer in the DOCSIS Network and its components is made, mainly in utilizing a larger breadth of the communications spectrum already provisioned by the coaxial/fiber infrastructure.  

The real beauty of the DOCSIS 4.0 standard comes in the form of ease of adoption from the average cable internet service consumer. No additional physical lines and expensive equipment will be needed to use the DOCSIS 4.0 capabilities once it is adopted by their service provider. The same line that drops a DOCSIS 3.1 connection into their home today will be the one providing the DOCSIS 4.0 service in the future. To the contrary, in the early days of the fiber only internet service networks many consumers were paying thousands of dollars to have fiber optic lines routed to their home or a nearby drop point. Because there was no comparable alternatives capable of providing 1Gig+ speeds to homes other than fiber, at the time it the added infrastructure costs were a viable solution. This high upfront cost to fiber optic internet service solutions, along with the resistance from the cable service providers, could be attributed as one of the leading causes the fiber movement has all but ceased. Fortunately, the DOCSIS 4.0 standard will allow for incremental improvements to the HFC infrastructure as the cable service plants decide to move towards the more capable technology of fiber while moving away from coaxial lines.

According to Colin Mann from advanced-television.com, the three steps that "have been part of the DOCSIS process for over 20 years and constitute a time-proven method to deliver high-speed, low-cost, interoperable cable modems to consumers" (*CableLabs publishes DOCSIS 4.0 spec*) are specification, interoperability, and certification. Being in the first phase of the DOCSIS process, specification, the DOCSIS 4.0 standard might feel like a far off distant distant future but with minimal cost and effort required to actually implement the standard this distance future might not be so far off. Additional societal and business pressure to move to adoption of the DOCSIS 4.0 standard could speed the process along even faster.



### Physical Layer Revamp

The high level of innovation found in the physical layer changes specified in the DOCSIS 4.0 standard will allow for implementation using the existing cable television infrastructure; cable television plants, the service providers, will not require a large investment to take advantage of the new standard. Because "DOCSIS 4.0 focuses on the eventual use of the entire spectrum resources available in the cable environment... and on scalable cost-effective techniques to achieve full spectrum use" (*DOCSIS 4.0 Physical Layer Specification - Section 5.1- p.32*) the technological characteristics of the existing infrastructure provide the means necessary to carry signal transmission in the DOCSIS 4.0 specification.  Wikipedia.com states the maximum operating frequency of transport over the HFC network is 1000 MHz and so while the infrastructure medium is capable if higher frequency transmissions, technological advancements such as those presented in the DOCSIS 4.0 standard are required to fully utilize the entire frequency range available (*Hybrid fiber-coaxial*). The DOCSIS standard implementations of the past have aimed to better utilize the entirety of the spectrum physically capable within the HFC infrastructure and have iterated on the concept with each new specification release, DOCSIS 4.0 will continue the improvement in efficiency and capability of the HFC network's cable internet services.

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) will continue to be the duplexing technology used, moving from the DOCSIS 3.1 specification to the DOCSIS 4.0 specification, but the new standard will provide an improved physical layer change in the OFDM. These improvements in the OFDM physical layer take place as an improved Full-Duplex and an extended Frequency Division Duplexing. While the advancements found in the DOCSIS 4.0 are groundbreaking and provide high gains in both upstream and downstream cable internet capacities, the means in which they are achieved by iterating and leveraging past technologies is feat in itself. In essence, major the DOCSIS 3.1 standard has paved the way for new specifications, such as the DOCSIS 4.0 standard, to take the cable internet service world to the next level.



#### DOCSIS 4.0 Full-Duplex (FDX)

The Full-Duplex (FDX) implementation in the DOCSIS cable modem service standards allow for simultaneous communication of upstream and downstream channels across the  same frequency band. While DOSIS 3.1 did promise full-duplex capabilities, the specification itself did not provide duplexing across the entire spectrum the upstream and bandwidth channels occupied, and become somewhat of a misnomer.

Extending the DOCSIS 3.1 specification duplex capabilities, the DOCSIS 4.0 FDX targets a more effective means of in concurrent upstream and downstream within the frequency ranges of 108 MHz to 684 MHz. The DOCSIS specification will increase the DOCSIS 3.1 upstream frequency range and match the downstream capacity "to enable flexible usage of a portion of this spectrum for simultaneous upstream and downstream transmissions." (*DOCSIS 4.0 Physical Layer Specification - Section 5.1 - p.32* ). The new FDX technology will allow for a more efficient duplexed communication within the same spectrum, never before seen in cable internet technology. Lower latency and multigigabit symmetrical speeds are the achievements reached with the improvements found in the DOCSIS 4.0 FDX.  

Because the DOCSIS specifications, including the DOCISIS 4.0 specification, stress backwards compatibility the channel ban rules in the new standard include legacy DOCSIS specifications along with the extended upstream frequency range capabilities. Within the 576 MHz channel, the upstream and downstream transmissions will be able to function concurrently within the 108-684 MHz frequency. Previously implemented DOCSIS standards did not include upstream capabilities that were as efficient and capable complete full duplex transmissions; while the DOCSIS 3.1 standard did provide a full-duplex technology, the upstream and downstream transmission did not occupy the entirety of the spectrum allotted for communication. This efficient symmetric transmission of the upstream and downstream within the same spectrum band is the new and improved FDX technology provided by the DOCSIS 4.0 standard.  

The complete set of FDX channel band rules, which include legacy and non-FDX transmissions, provided in the official DOCSIS 4.0 standard can be seen in the figure below:

#### Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)

Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) is a cable internet physical layer technique that allows for the splitting of the receiver and transmitter operation to occur at different frequencies. DOCSIS 3.1 implement its own version of FDD that allowed for increased upstream and downstream capacities but the new DOCSIS 4.0 standard has taken the technology and improved upon it to expand the bandwidth capacities even further.

The extended spectrum approach, the DOCSIS 4.0 FDD, will "enable upstream spectrum up to 684 MHz and downstream spectrum to 1794 MHz, further enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the usable spectrum according to system needs." (*DOCSIS 4.0 Physical Layer Specification - Section 5.1- p.32*). The total bandwidth for the upstream channel is extended to the 6 Gbit capacity while the total bandwidth for the downstream channel is extended to 10Gbit capacity with this extended FDD approach. 

The extended spectrum, as the name implies, expands the previous 1.2 GHz of usable spectrum to 1.8 GHz, allowing for the complete utilization of the upstream transmission within the frequency range of 108-684 MHz. This FDD extension is possible through the use of the splitting six OFDM channels, of 96 MHz each, across the 576 MHz upstream frequency spectrum of 108 MHz to 684 MHz. Non-FDD transmission on the upstream channel occurs below 108 MHz and above 684 MHz. The extended spectrum to the 1.8 GHz frequency range also allows for the 10Gbit downstream capacity the use of six OFDM channels across the entire 1794 MHz spectrum, up to 192 MHz per channel.

The complete set of FDD upstream channel band rules, which include legacy and non-FDD transmissions, provided in the official DOCSIS 4.0 standard can be seen in the figure below:

## Seeing the World Through 10G

In light of the recent COVID-19 virus pandemic impacting the world, at the time of writing, there has been a worldwide shift to remote centric business; be it by government mandating or health conscious business owners, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced the the entire world to adapt by moving capable employees to work remotely. This shift in the work culture has brought rise to many new tools that revolve around the ever increasing demand for remote work adaption such as video conferencing and file sharing tools, both of which are bandwidth intensive. To the chagrin of many first-time remote working global citizens, their home internet connections have not been able to perform adequately with the use of the many new remote work based tooling.

This is not a result of inadequate **downstream** bandwidth but a result of inadequate **upstream** bandwidth. Until now, the majority of internet activity for most people has revolved around incoming data, never has the requirement for a strong outgoing connection been a factor. Even with a DOCSIS 3.1, the latest implementation of DOCSIS, 1Gbit connection the upstream bandwidth comes in at a fraction of the total bandwidth available, a mere 3.5% (*Comcast Xfinity Plans*). Live video streaming technologies have become commonplace yet the upstream cable internet service capabilities available to the average consumer has not matched the increased use and advancements of higher quality video.

Other areas of industry and technological fields, such as augmented reality and virtual reality, are becoming ever more dependent on data to drive business decisions and so the need for increased data transfer rates has also risen. Data transmission of extremely high resolution video and large file sizes to and from devices will become seamless with the new DOCSIS 4.0 technology. Businesses, large and small, will be enabled to innovate in their field with the increase in total bandwidth with minimal effort by utilizing DOCSIS 4.0 services.

With the extended Full-Duplex technology found in the new DOCSIS 4.0 specification opening up the upstream bandwidth and the accompanying increase in societal demand for better consumer connections, the implementation phases of the DOCSIS 4.0 rollout could come sooner as cable service plants adopting the new new technology would be of great benefit. The day the average consumer can have a DOCSIS 4.0 data transmission, 10Gbit downstream/6Gbit upstream from their home could come sooner than expected when compared to legacy DOCSIS timelines. Ever increasing focus on bandwidth intensive applications and technology along with the desire for improved means of communication will greatly benefit from the DOCSIS 4.0 specification implementation.



## Conclusion

The DOCSIS 4.0 standard announcement could not have at a better time for modern society. As the need for higher bandwidth capacity is being felt across the board, the next wave of cable modem internet service technology can alleviate the strains being caused by the data transmission caps in place today, primarily in the upstream channels of all cable internet service technologies. Shepherding in the new standard will be championed by many leading cable service providers as there is much profit to be made at little cost that will yield major benefits for society as a whole. The reuse of existing HCF infrastructure capable by the advancements in the physical layer of cable modem technology, FDX and FDD, in the DOCSIS 4.0 standard will allow for rapid adoption and use worldwide. Leading to a more interconnection global society enabled by greater internet bandwidth speeds, not only in the business and technology sectors, but in the average consumer's home.
